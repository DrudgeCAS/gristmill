0.2.0
~~~~~

This is mostly a bug fix release.  Problems in the handling of bounds in Fortran
printer and in the treatment purely scalar intermediates without any external
indices are fixed.  And the handling of summations are improved with less
intermediates by removing duplicated and shallowly-defined ones.  Most
importantly, the automatic result checker has been fixed.
