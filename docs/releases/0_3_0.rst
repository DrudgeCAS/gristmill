0.3.0
~~~~~

This release primarily features the addition of product optimization
strategies.  It was hoped that the new default ``SEARCHED`` will provide big
improvement over the previous behaviour, which can now be accessed by ``BEST``.
Unfortunately, the improvement is only marginal.  But the new strategy
``GREEDY`` could be used for large problems defying deeper optimizations.
