0.5.0
~~~~~

The primarily focus of this release is the optimization for problems with terms
composed of a large number of factors.  The contraction optimization algorithm
has been upgraded with bits replacing hash tables for storing and manipulating
factor/summation sets.  Significant improvements in performance can be seen in
problems with say 20 factors.

A minor new feature is the addition of an option to disable the inlining of
shallow intermediates in the optimizer.  This can be used in cases where the
default behaviour is undesired.
