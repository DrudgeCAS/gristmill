This is probably the largest revision made to gristmill ever.  Most notably,
the summation optimization algorithm is completely rewritten.  This algorithms
is based on the idea in the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for max clique problem, and
it finally fills the last remaining gap between the automatically optimized
result with best optimization carried by human.  The full algorithm can be
slow.  However, options exist to fine-tune the balance between the time of
optimization and the quality of the result.  Quite fortunately, for CCSD
equations, the greedy algorithm actually gives the same as the full
optimization.  It is likely that generally good results can be given for
CC-style theories.

Another revision is that now the code can handle nonlinear factors like
:math:`(t_{ij})^2`.  Also added is the capability to disable any given
heuristic of optimization.  Bug fixed in this release include,

* Non-optimal evaluation will no longer be wrongly picked for optimization of a
  single contraction.

* Inputs with neither summation nor external indices now will not crash the
  program.

* Tensor definitions with external indices not actually used in its content
  will no longer have incorrect result.
